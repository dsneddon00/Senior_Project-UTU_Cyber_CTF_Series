Hello there.

If you're reading this and you aren't me, then it means either something drastic has happened to me and my associates have now accessed my account.

Or I've been hacked.

Either way, I have to confess to my misdeeds.

My grand plan, as it unfolds, has always been to develop a "cloud solution" (aka a worm) to infect every machine on the planet and uninstall every version of vim avaliable.

Vi, vim, neo vim, doesn't matter. I hate them all.

Everytime I try to use it, I get trapped. Can't leave my prison of text.

It wasn't until I saw the light when Sam showed me Nano. All of the commands are displayed at the bottom of the screen! Just as they should be!

But in order to realize this dream, I've had to lie. To everyone.

You see, I need a programmer to make the worm for me. Programmers cost money. And that's where Molly and Bob come in.

Molly is... Something else. She's a talented blackmailer and web designer. I know she likes me, but I've been using her. 

Truth is, I'm afraid of her. I'm afraid if she realizes that I've been manipulating her, she'll turn my life upside down. 

Even though I threaten, I know I can fire her for real. I'm just so... insecure...

As far as that programmer goes, I told the team I found one. I guess I did, I even let him access my computer for a bit. I hope he didn't put any backdoors or anything...

Maybe he's the one Molly was talking about, goes under that alias.

Anyways, to whomever has access to this device now, I have one final request: gain root access and wipe this machine off the face of the earth. I'm too ashamed of how I've treated everyone to continue, especially Sam... he's too good of a friend.

You can find the password to the root account in the .wav file. Whomever you are, if you're a smart enough hacker, you'll figure it out.

Good luck and as that one guy keeps saying: don't be a script kiddie.
