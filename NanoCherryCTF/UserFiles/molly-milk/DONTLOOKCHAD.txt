Dear Chad,

Cherries, Ice Cream, and Milk,
In the bowl of life, we mix and swirl,
Like cherries, ice cream, and milk's swirl.
Cherries so red, plucked from the tree,
Sweet as your love, pure as can be.
Ice cream so smooth, so cool and white,
Melts in my mouth, with sheer delight.
Milk so pure, so creamy and rich,
The base of our love, the perfect mix.
Together they blend, in perfect harmony,
Like you and I, so sweet, so free.
With each bite, my heart takes flight,
As our love grows, so strong, so bright.
Cherries, ice cream, and milk,
Our love's ingredients, so smooth and silk.
Forever and always, our love will stay,
Like the sweet taste, that never fades away.

Love,
Molly

P.S. I'll hold on tight to that first part of your password you gave me! If anything ever happens to you, we'll all be sure to keep your dream of erasing vim off of all systems alive!
