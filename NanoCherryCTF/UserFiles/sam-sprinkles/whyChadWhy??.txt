Dude Chad! I thought we were bros!

I don't know if you'll ever read this, but ever since Molly joined the company, you've changed!

We had such a bromance going on and now you're letting her dig her nails into you!

I know you said you're not that into her, but I see how you tool look at eachother! It was always get paid before milk maids!

But I guess you've fallen for a milk maid now! I'm worried about you man...

Either way, I'll keep your secret password segment nice and hidden.

I hope we can hangout again soon.

Your friend,

Sam
