From the money laundering to the cloud solutions, we've now traced it down to one last individual: Chad-Cherry.

It might appear that he's just a charismatic CEO with an ice cream store... But I assure you there is more to him than just that.

One last time, I need you to breach the system, uncover their plans, and retrieve all of the flags on the system so we can put a stop to this madness.

And this time, I've already breached the machine. See if you can find the backdoor I planted on the machine. You'll be able to use that to gain initial access. Of course, I'm sure you can find other ways in as well.

I'll see you on the other side. Good luck, and don't be a script kiddie.
