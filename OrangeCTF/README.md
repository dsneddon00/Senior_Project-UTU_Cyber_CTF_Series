## Setup

In order to get the file upload vulnerability to work properly, be sure to set the permissions to allow any writing and executing in both the uploads directory as well as the actual contact.php script Be sure to put the file in the /var/www/html/ directory so apache2 can run the server and the php files. (:

## Intial RCE

The extensions that work for the web shell as of tested, are php and phar. Phar is a php archive format file that can also run PHP code.
