THIS CHERRY GUY WON'T GET OFF MY BACK!!

Look, I told him, the plan is simple: become a silicon valley startup offering 'cloud solutions' and 'innovations' and the investors will come flooding in! But now he's wanting that he doesn't care what we develop, so long as we embed each of our products with his special 'package'.

That guy weird me out. He won't get off my back! When I told him I wanted a raise, he told me that he could raze my entire house! On top of that, I still don't know what his 'package' is! He keeps telling me to just let his IT team take care of it, but NO!! THIS IS MY BUSINESS NOT HIS!

Must be something to do with his new 'nano' technology that he's working on. Is he trying to take over the world or just replace vim?
