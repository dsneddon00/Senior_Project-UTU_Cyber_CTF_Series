# Senior_Project-UTU_Cyber_CTF_Series

The UTU Cyber CTF Series is a series of capture the flag games meant to provide vulnerable machines to teach students and club members practical skills in ethical hacking. This repository will contain the documentation, source code, and configuration guides for each 'box'. Each box is a self-contained themed CTF that is meant to run on its own, seperate from the others. Each box is meant as a stepping stone in diffculty and complexity and is designed with learning specifically in mind.

I encourage members of the community who wish to play these CTFs to administer self control in viewing the source code as it will have spoilers for how each vulnerability is exploited as well as the flags hidden within.

As the project goes on, I will provide Virtual Machine images meant to be deployed for use as well as guidance for how to use them.
