Hello hacker,

Clever work getting into the FTP server. But we have work to do.

Looks like Toby Toast has made an encryption program on his server. It looks seriously vulnerable.

Your task will be to reverse engineer it and decypher any messages he's been sending with it.

Good luck and don't be a script kiddie.
