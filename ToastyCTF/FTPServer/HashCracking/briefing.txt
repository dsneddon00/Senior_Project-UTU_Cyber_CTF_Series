<AUDIO TRANSCRIPT>

Hello hacker,

At the very least, you've broken into the FTP Server. Kudos to you.

Anyways, I managed to intercept some wireless traffic and I have a password hash of one of the users on the target.

To be specific, his name is Jerry Jam. A colleague of Toby Toast's and a master chemist of illegal jam.

I know that Jerry's Rockyou account was breached way back, do with that information what you will. 

The hash will be stored in a text file. I need you to crack it.

Once you have cracked it, try using it to break into the main server.

Good luck and don't be a script kiddie.
