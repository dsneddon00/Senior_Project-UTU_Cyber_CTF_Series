<AUDIO TRANSCRIPT>

Hello hacker,

If you've made it this far, then you've already broken into the FTP Server. Congratulations, however we are still not done.

Before you is a .wav file containing what sounds like radio signals. 

Seems like our friend Toby has encoding something secret inside. He might be trying to throw us off.

Decypher the data behind the signals. Uncover what he's trying to hide.

Good luck and don't be a script kiddie.
