  <h1>Betty Butter's Chat Log</h1>

  <div id="chat-log">
    <p>betty-butter: Hey you guys check it out! I made a page on our website we can chat at!</p>
    <p>jerry-jam: Why can't we just use our phones??</p>
    <p>betty-butter: Because that's lame sauce. Maybe if enough people find it, we can turn this into the next 4chan!</p>
    <p>toby-toast: That's dumb, no one without dev privileges can even write anything on it. Plus, it's not indexed, so users can't find it...</p>
    <p>jerry-jam: Yeah, that is a <i>FUZZY</i> problem we've got here! Lol!</p>
    <p>betty-butter: ...</p>
    <p>toby-toast: ...</p>
    <p>jerry-jam: Screw you guys. Y'all are greasier than my ex-wife after Tequila and Taco Bell.</p>
